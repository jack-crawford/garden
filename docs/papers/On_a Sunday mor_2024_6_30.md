On a Sunday morning at a not-unreasonable hour, one can stand in the middle of I Street around 15th or 16th and see from Forsy Bottom to Penn Quarter without the interruption of civilian vehicles. A bus or two may go past, you may need to move out of the way of an ambulance, but in either case you'll have plenty of warning. Downtown D.C. is an incredibly dead part of town on the weekends, bet- ore the hordes of tourists rise and descend upon the center of government, and in that echoing state of glass and stone and concrete, the true inhabitants of downtown are revealed. Charitable groups a visit Mcpherson Square Park on Saturdays and Sundays to give out meals and the area fills with those unhoused and in need who dwell with in a close radius of the White House. Sometimes the providers have with them a preacher, whose sermons must be something along the lines of "don't worry, you meek and poor and ill and neglected of society, you'll enter the Kingdom of Heaven first, but enjoy these sandwiches and granola bars first, McPherson used
to be a residence for many of these folks, used to be filled with tents and makeshift shelters, but that was
a couple of years ago now and the park is now mostly a place to spend the days before the little diaspora scatters to their various shelters and alleys for the nichts.
