The sunlight made stars out of the cracked scodes scattered through the valley and the early morning suddenly seemed worthwhile. Her watch-shift had somehow been drawn for the dawn every morning since the unit set out from the old walls. nearly a month before, but she had not complained. I It was Lusia's first mission of any real import, and she was certainly the most junior member on among them so while the predawn awakenings were Nude and the mules were left in her care on the
march, the time outside in the wilderness was rard enough. The watch wasn't much work, anyway. They
were for beyond the pylon border. any threats here would be for from subtle. All she had to do was sit and watch the sun rise over them. Her cloak, standard issue, was warm enough for the job, but sitting on a rock with her sword belt caused some awkward lines and cold air snuck in. Pacing across a crest over their campsite, the prospect of their missions and seemed distant. How could anyone find the anyone out here? What are I writing, here? It's generic and ambiguous but kind of fin, Bleh. Perhaps something more concrete could be fun. Some projects are hard to motivate onself through.
