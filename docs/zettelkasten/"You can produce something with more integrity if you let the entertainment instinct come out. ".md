"You can produce something with more integrity if you let the entertainment instinct come out. "

"for me, that's exactly right ... When I'm writing I'm feeling something like, I want to entertain you for twenty pages ... I want you to not be able to stop reading ... If I concentrate on those ideas, the end result is deeper and smarter and weirder and funnier and more honest then it I'd planned it all out"
