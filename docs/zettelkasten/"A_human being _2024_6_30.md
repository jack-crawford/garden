"A human being is a part of the whole, called by
us Universe
part limited in time and space.
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as
something
separated from the rest, - a kind of optical
delusion of his consciousness. The striving
to
free oneself from
this delusion is the one issue
of true religion. Not to nourish the delusion but
to try to overcome it is the way to reach the
attainable measure of peace of mind." - Einstein
